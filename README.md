# TypingAutoType
Simple auto-typing chrome extension for Typing.com made by Illumina

## How to install
1. Download this repo as a zip (Code<Download ZIP)
2. Extract the zip file to a new folder (name doesn't matter)
3. Open chrome://extensions and make sure developer mode is on (top-right)
4. Click "Load Unpacked" in the top-left and select your extracted folder
5. Pin the extension (optional)

## How to use
For custom XPaths, click on the extension, input your XPath and delay and click "Start Typing with Custom XPath"

## I don't know what an XPath is, just show me how to auto type
1. Go to https://www.typing.com/student/tests and pick a test. It can be one of the 1-3-5 minute tests or the 1-2-3 page tests
2. Click on the extension, input a delay (I recommend 150 as this will yield a reasonable WPM and not something ridiculous and humanly impossible like 500) click "Start Typing with predefined XPath". Be sure not to click off of the extension until it finished typing!
